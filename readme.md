# Catbus 3000

This is a Breakout / Pong game that I made for my Project Zero, as part of my Web Development Immersive 13 with General Assembly. The game is written in JavaScript and uses the HTML5 Canvas element to render and animate the board.

## Libraries
1. jQuery
2. Fontawesome

## Features
1. Player has 3 lives
2. Score 10 points for every target destroyed
3. Catbus turns left to right with keyboard directional controls
4. Mouse / trackpad control functionality

## How to view app
1. Play it here: http://danielmoi.github.io/ga-01-breakout/src
2. Clone / fork my repo: https://github.com/danielmoi/ga-01-breakout (and open src/index.html in your browser)

## Approach
1. Set up basic canvas
1. Draw and animate ball
1. Draw and animate paddle, attach keyboard and mouse event handlers
1. Draw and animate targets, implement collision detection
3. Place and animate Catbus
1. Implement game states (start, pause, restart, win, lose)
1. Update visual design elements
