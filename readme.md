# Catbus 3000

This is a Breakout / Pong game that I made for my Project Zero, as part of my Web Development Immersive 13 with General Assembly.

## Libraries
1. jQuery
2. Fontawesome

## Features
1. Player has 3 lives
2. Score 10 points for every target destroyed
3. Catbus turns left to right with keyboard directional controls
4. Mouse / trackpad control functionality

## How to view app
1. Play it here: http://danielmoi.github.io/ga-01-breakout/src
2. Clone / fork my repo: https://github.com/danielmoi/ga-01-breakout (and open src/index.html in your browser)

## Approach
1. Follow tutorial from Mozilla (see below)
2. Customize code into modular functions and custom variables
1. Refactor code from setInterval to requestAnimationFrame
3. Implement Catbus as the paddle
